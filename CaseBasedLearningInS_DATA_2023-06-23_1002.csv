In every single one, the essential skills needed are: helping collaborators ask the right questions, communicating the statistical methods in a way they understand, and teaching them collaborative tools (ie GitHub, GitHub projects, etc.) to bring them to the table and be accountable for their role. I suggest not cases, but assignments / projects where students learn those skills and demonstrate them. ",0,0,2

But I do remember that the collaboration class helped significantly with the day-to-day operations as a statistician that methods-based classes won't cover and it helped make the transition from student to statistician much smoother. Bryan Vasquez plan was particularly impactful because I didn't understand the value of SAP until I've run into problems surrounding not having one. It might be beneficial to discuss problems that can arise without an SAP (major impact: longer turnaround time with more discussion). I can't remember what First Week as a Biostatistician entailed, but things like FTE, work load and hours worked, ethical issues, etc are things that we would not get from the biostatistics program otherwise and these situations can be difficult to navigate. ","If any of these cases were covered - apologies.   - A case in which a collaborator decides to change the project (hypothesis, study question, exclusion criteria, etc) when it goes against the SAP. It's easy enough to discuss in class that we stick to the SAP, but often times the collaborator doesn't understand/doesn't care.   - A case in which the collaborator doesn't know what they want.   - A case in which a collaborator knows what they want but are asking for the wrong thing.   - A case in which you, as the statistician, don't know the answer or aren't familiar with the methods. This happens often enough to mention, especially as an entry-level statistician. ",75,0,2
